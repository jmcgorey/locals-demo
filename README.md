# locals-demo

## Description

This is a demo for James's locals problem.

## Goal

-   Provide a framework for housing a "Local" character in its natural environment
-   Must:
    -   Have a background image with the local business, something where the local could sit in its habitat
    -   Provide an animated sprite for the "Local", and let it sit somewhere where it makes sense
        -   Character must sit in roughly the same place depending on screen size
    -   Be able to click/tap somewhere and initiate an interaction
    -   Let the user go through a dialog tree with A or B answers to questions
        -   Ultimately the goal is to save the image/Local, but actual saving operating can probably wait
